SUGGESTIONS-

1. Consider implementing the Enter keyboard functionality for loggin-in.
2. Allow the adminstrator to create events on other time zones.
3. Remove close button, terminate the program if the upper right close button is clicked and move save button to the right.
4. Let the user know that he/she entered incorrect information or remove first item from the list as an available option.
