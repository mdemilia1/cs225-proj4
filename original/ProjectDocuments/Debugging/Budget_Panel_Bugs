Amounts over a million dollars are not shown properly due to lack of space to display decimal values. 
Also a problem for values larger than ten million. 

After clicking on the "details" buttons in the side panel, then clicking on the "report" button, it throws a NullPointer Exception. See Budget_View_Empty_Report.exception.
