EVENT REPORT PANEL-
    VIEW BUTTON
		It displays true when no one is registered for the event and a commitee has been added.
	    It displays some event information and event_report_2.error when no one is registered for the event and a sub event has been added.
	    //RESOLVED- It displays 1 when no one is registered for the event(don't not know why yet).

EVENT MANAGEMENT PANEL-
    Main event location not displayed on the Event Details.
    Furthermore, I did not find a way to initially set it to a value	//FIXED or edit it afterwards.
	Under "Event Details" the "Edit This Event" button when clicked, shows the editable dates one month behind for both start and end times from what was chosen as the Sign-up process. 
		Also, since we do not have an actual description to show the user when the Main Event is, unless specified under details, it is easy to get confused.

SUB EVENT DETAILS PANEL-
    1. "edit" button shows a pop-up window that is resizable. Not a bug per se but it allows the user to create a weird looking window.
//FIXED    2. It has an empty JTextFieldArea that does not seem to do anything.
    3. If a sub event spans many days, it only shows its start date.
    4. If a user clicks on the Sub Event Details and there are no events, then clicks the "Edit Event" button, then clicks the save button,
         an exception is thrown. See Edit_Ghost_Sub_Event.exception.
    5. If a user clicks on the Sub Event Details and there are no events, then clicks the "Remove Event" button, then clicks the yes option,
         an exception is thrown. See Remove_Ghost_Sub_Event.exception.

USER MANAGEMENT PANEL-
    1. Admin may remove himself from being an admin, an action that can't be undone. It throws an exception. See Remove_Admin_Privileges.exception.
    2. A regular user after given administrator privileges can do the same as above as well as demoting the main admin to a regular user. See above.
