EMSLauncher.java is the main class.

You can find the github repository at:
https://github.com/MassBayCS225/EMS
 
If you want to build a JAR for this,
just build the JAR first and then copy/paste your EMS_DB folder
into the same fodler as the JAR.



Also, a couple notes about how to work with this program.


The "Manager" classes basically serve as the connection between the GUI
and the back end. The manager checks privilege levels, and if it passes,
then writes to the database.


Also, there isn't a real password encryption system.
There are a couple classes related to it, that one member
began building, but never finished.


In the Main folder, there are 2 classes:
ClearData.java and SetUpData.java
Those were used for testing purposes.
ClearData clears the entire database.
SetUpData, sets the database up with dummy data.


A few of the GUI classes were manually coded, as opposed to
being created with the netbeans designer, so when you go to
view the .form, you'll just see a blank screen, despite the fact
that the source actually has code in it.


If you want to add data to the table, you have to create
an Input_Event (or whatever object you want to insert)
wrapper class. So you create an Event object.
You pass the Event object's details into an Input_Event.
Then you pass the Input_Event to the database.
It's a little tedious, and redundant, but that's how it is.
