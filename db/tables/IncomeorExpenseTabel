Income and Expenses are Ideticel in almost everything, except a few hardcoded strings that differentiate between the two.
No limitations for maximum or minimum in either.

One should be removed entirely, as they don't seem to interact for a full total.

Both interact with each respective GUI JPanel independityly, However, we could generic the GUI with reletive ease and have the
Hardcode string only work up there.
The GUI does the adding comparison(totals)?
